Example for a Shift Happens task on ImageNet-Patch
==================================================

Evaluate the robustness of classifiers to the presence of adversarial patches 
from the ImageNet-Patch dataset [1]. 
The raw images (before application of the patches) come from the validation 
set of ImageNet, and are the same set used in RobustBench [2].

Dataset Creation
----------------

The raw images are collected from the validation set of the ImageNet dataset.

The ten optimized patches proposed in the paper are then applied to such images to create the perturbed data.
The patch optimization follows Brown et al.[3].

Evaluation Metrics
------------------

- Robust accuracy: correct classification of the images with the applied patch.

Expected Insights/Relevance
---------------------------

This dataset was designed to measure the robustness of the models to the application of adversarial patches. Adding this test can give further insights on robustness of the model as a general property, beyond the evaluation that is usually performed against one specific perturbation bound (e.g., $L_\infty$ norm with maximum size of 8/255)

Access
------

We release the dataset on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/6568778), as well as the code to generate patches and to apply them dynamically to custom images (https://github.com/pralab/ImageNet-Patch).
