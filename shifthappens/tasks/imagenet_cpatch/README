Evaluating Models on ImageNet Images with Corrupted Patches
==============================================

# Task Description
Adding evaluation task under natural patch corruption [1]


## Dataset Creation
The patches of raw images from ImageNet-1k validation dataset are naturally corrupted.

Following [2], 15 corruption types in ImageNet-C dataset [2] are considered, each of which has 5 different
severity levels.


## Evaluation Metrics
1) Standard Classification Accuracy: the accuracy on raw images of ImageNet-1k validation dataset
2) Fooling rate: the percentrage of misclassified images 


## Expected Insights/Relevance
The robustness to natural patch corruption

## Data
The images of ImageNet-1k validation dataset is assumed.
